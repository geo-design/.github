Geo-Design are an established specialist consultancy working across a range of sectors. We have a central focus on engineering geological and hydrogeological characterisation, and rock engineering design for both surface and underground structures.

Our approach is to establish a fundamental appreciation of the governing physical conditions to provide understanding and risk mitigation to projects, as well as representative inputs to analyses, using state-of-the-art modelling software. As a result, our designs are carefully engineered, practical solutions that complement the natural environment.
